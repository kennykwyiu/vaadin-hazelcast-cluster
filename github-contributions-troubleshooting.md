# Troubleshooting Missing GitHub Contributions

## Overview

GitHub tracks contributions based on commits made to repositories. These contributions are then displayed on your profile page and in the repository's contribution graph. If you've made commits but don't see them reflected as contributions, it can be confusing. This document explains how GitHub tracks contributions and outlines the most common reasons why they might not be appearing, along with detailed troubleshooting steps.

## How GitHub Tracks Contributions

GitHub primarily counts contributions based on the following activities:

-   **Commits**: Commits made to the default branch (usually `main` or `master`) of a repository.
-   **Pull Requests**: Opening a pull request.
-   **Issues**: Opening an issue.
-   **Code Reviews**: Submitting a code review.

For commits to count as contributions, they must meet specific criteria:

1.  **Commit Author Email**: The email address used in the commit must be associated with your GitHub account.
2.  **Repository Ownership**: The repository must be owned by you, an organization you're a member of, or a public repository where you've contributed.
3.  **Default Branch**: The commit must be made to the default branch of the repository (e.g., `main` or `master`).
4.  **Not a Fork**: Commits to a fork will only count if they are part of a pull request that is merged into the upstream repository.

## Common Reasons for Missing Contributions

Here are the most frequent reasons why your commits might not be showing up as contributions:

### 1. Incorrect Commit Email Address

This is by far the most common reason. GitHub uses the email address in your Git commit history to link commits to your GitHub account. If the email address in your commit doesn't match an email address associated with your GitHub account, the contributions won't be attributed to you.

-   **Public vs. Private Email**: If you're using a private email address for commits (e.g., GitHub's `noreply` email address) but haven't added it to your GitHub account settings, or if you're using a different email address entirely.
-   **Typo**: A simple typo in the email address configured in your Git client.

### 2. Commit Not to the Default Branch

Only commits made to the default branch (typically `main` or `master`) of a repository count towards your contribution graph. If you're committing to a feature branch or another non-default branch, those commits won't appear on your contribution graph until they are merged into the default branch.

### 3. Repository Ownership or Visibility

-   **Private Repository**: If the repository is private, contributions to it will only be visible on your profile if you have enabled the option to show private contributions in your profile settings.
-   **Forked Repository**: Commits made directly to a forked repository will not show up on your contribution graph unless those commits are part of a pull request that is merged into the *original* (upstream) repository.

### 4. Commit Date Issues

-   **Future Dates**: If your system clock is set to a future date, commits might appear to be made in the future and won't show up on your current contribution graph until that future date arrives.
-   **Time Zone Differences**: While less common for completely missing contributions, significant time zone discrepancies can sometimes make contributions appear on a different day than expected.

### 5. Git Configuration Issues

-   **Global vs. Local Configuration**: Your Git `user.email` and `user.name` can be configured globally or locally for a specific repository. If you have a global configuration that's correct but an incorrect local configuration overrides it, commits in that specific repository might not be attributed correctly.

### 6. GitHub Caching/Delay

Occasionally, there might be a slight delay in GitHub's caching or processing, especially for very recent commits. However, this is usually a matter of minutes, not hours or days. If contributions are missing for an extended period, it's likely one of the other reasons.

### 7. Commits Made by Others

If you are collaborating on a repository and someone else pushes commits that you authored locally, ensure that their Git configuration correctly preserves your authorship information. If they re-author the commits or use their own email, the contributions might not be attributed to you.



## Troubleshooting Steps and Verification Methods

If your contributions are not appearing, follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:

### Step 1: Verify Your Git Configuration

First, check the `user.email` and `user.name` configured in your Git client. This is the most frequent cause of missing contributions.

1.  **Check Global Configuration**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name
    git config --global user.email
    ```
2.  **Check Local Repository Configuration**: Navigate to the root directory of your `vaadin-hazelcast-cluster` project and run:
    ```bash
    git config user.name
    git config user.email
    ```

    *Expected Output*: The `user.email` should be an email address associated with your GitHub account (either your primary email or a verified secondary email).

    *Action*: If the email addresses do not match or are incorrect, set them:
    ```bash
    # To set globally (for all your Git repositories)
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

    # To set locally (only for the current repository, overriding global)
    cd /path/to/your/vaadin-hazelcast-cluster
    git config user.name "Your Name"
    git config user.email "your_email@example.com"
    ```
    **Important**: After correcting the email, you might need to rewrite your past commits to update the author information. This is a more advanced step and should be done carefully, especially if you've already pushed to a shared repository. For new commits, simply correcting the config is enough.

### Step 2: Verify Email Addresses on GitHub

Ensure that the email address used in your Git commits is added and verified on your GitHub account.

1.  **Go to GitHub Settings**: Log in to GitHub, click your profile photo in the upper-right corner, then click **Settings**.
2.  **Emails**: In the left sidebar, click **Emails**.
3.  **Check Verified Emails**: Look for the email address that you are using in your Git commits. It should be listed and marked as "Verified".

    *Action*: If the email is not listed or not verified, add it and follow the verification steps.

### Step 3: Check the Commit History

Inspect the commit history on GitHub to see what email address is associated with your commits.

1.  **Go to Your Repository**: Navigate to `https://github.com/kennykwyiu/vaadin-hazelcast-cluster`.
2.  **View Commits**: Click on the "commits" link (e.g., `X commits` above the file list).
3.  **Inspect a Commit**: Click on a specific commit. You should see the author and committer information. Verify that the email address displayed there is the one linked to your GitHub account.

    *Expected*: If the email is correct, your GitHub profile picture should appear next to the commit. If it shows a generic avatar or a different name, the email is likely not linked.

### Step 4: Confirm Default Branch

Ensure your commits are on the default branch of the repository.

1.  **Go to Repository Page**: On your GitHub repository page, check the branch selector (usually says `main` or `master`).
2.  **Check Branch of Commits**: If you pushed to a different branch, those commits won't count until they are merged into the default branch.

    *Action*: If your commits are on a non-default branch, create a pull request to merge them into the default branch.

### Step 5: Check Private Contributions Setting

If the repository is private, ensure you have enabled the display of private contributions.

1.  **Go to Your Profile Page**: Navigate to `https://github.com/kennykwyiu`.
2.  **Contribution Settings**: Look for the "Contribution settings" dropdown (often near the contribution graph).
3.  **Toggle Private Contributions**: Ensure "Private contributions" is checked.

### Step 6: Verify System Clock

An incorrect system clock can cause issues with commit timestamps.

1.  **Check System Time**: Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    date
    ```
    *Action*: If your system time is incorrect, adjust it. For Linux, you might use `sudo apt install ntp` or `sudo timedatectl set-ntp true`.

### Step 7: Re-push (if necessary and safe)

If you corrected your Git email address *after* making commits, those past commits still have the old email. To update them, you would need to rewrite history. This is generally **not recommended** for repositories that others have already cloned, as it can cause conflicts.

For personal projects or if you are sure no one else has pulled your changes, you can use `git filter-branch` or `git rebase -i` to rewrite the author information. However, this is an advanced operation and should be approached with caution. A simpler approach for new commits is to just ensure your Git config is correct going forward.

### Step 8: Contact GitHub Support

If you have gone through all the above steps and your contributions are still not appearing, it might be an issue on GitHub's side, or a more complex configuration problem. In such cases, contacting [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/) with details of your repository, commit SHAs, and the email addresses involved would be the next step.

## Conclusion

Missing GitHub contributions are almost always due to a mismatch between the email address in your Git commits and the email addresses associated with your GitHub account. By systematically checking your Git configuration, GitHub email settings, and commit history, you can usually identify and resolve the problem. Remember to always use a verified email address linked to your GitHub account for your Git commits to ensure proper attribution of your hard work.
