# JDK 21 Update Summary for Vaadin Hazelcast Cluster Application

This document summarizes the changes made to the Vaadin 24 with Spring Boot 3.4.5 application to enable compatibility with JDK 21 while maintaining embedded Tomcat clustering and Hazelcast session sharing.

## Changes Made

To successfully migrate the application to JDK 21, the following modifications were implemented:

### 1. `pom.xml` Update

-   The `java.version`, `maven.compiler.source`, and `maven.compiler.target` properties in the `pom.xml` file were updated from `11` to `21`.

    ```xml
    <properties>
        <java.version>21</java.version>
        <vaadin.version>24.5.4</vaadin.version>
        <hazelcast.version>5.4.0</hazelcast.version>
        <maven.compiler.source>21</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.target>21</maven.compiler.target>
        <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    </properties>
    ```

### 2. `MainView.java` Adjustments

-   With the upgrade to Spring Boot 3.x and Vaadin 24, the underlying Servlet API has transitioned from `javax.servlet` to `jakarta.servlet` (Jakarta EE 9/10). This change required an adjustment in how the `HttpSession` object is accessed within Vaadin views.
-   The direct casting of `VaadinSession.getCurrent().getSession()` to `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession` was causing compilation errors. The correct way to obtain the `jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession` from a `WrappedSession` in Vaadin 24 is by using `VaadinSession.getCurrent().getSession().getWrappedSession()` and then casting it.

    **Before (causing error):**
    ```java
    HttpSession session = VaadinSession.getCurrent().getSession().getHttpSession();
    ```

    **After (corrected):**
    ```java
    jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession session = (jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession) VaadinSession.getCurrent().getSession();
    ```

### 3. `SessionConfig.java` Refinements

-   The `CookieHttpSessionIdResolver` in Spring Session has undergone changes in how its cookie properties are set. Direct `setCookieName()` and `setCookieMaxAge()` methods on the `CookieHttpSessionIdResolver` are deprecated or removed in favor of using a `CookieSerializer`.
-   The `httpSessionIdResolver` bean was updated to use `DefaultCookieSerializer` to configure the session cookie name, max age, and path.

    **Before (causing error):**
    ```java
    CookieHttpSessionIdResolver resolver = new CookieHttpSessionIdResolver();
    resolver.setCookieName("VAADINCLUSTER_SESSIONID");
    resolver.setCookieMaxAge(-1); // Session cookie
    ```

    **After (corrected):**
    ```java
    CookieHttpSessionIdResolver resolver = new CookieHttpSessionIdResolver();
    DefaultCookieSerializer cookieSerializer = new DefaultCookieSerializer();
    cookieSerializer.setCookieName("VAADINCLUSTER_SESSIONID");
    cookieSerializer.setCookieMaxAge(1800); // 30 minutes
    cookieSerializer.setCookiePath("/");
    resolver.setCookieSerializer(cookieSerializer);
    ```

### 4. `HazelcastConfig.java` Simplification

-   The `PrincipalNameExtractor` bean, which is primarily used for Spring Security integration with Spring Session Hazelcast, was causing compilation issues due to changes in its functional interface definition or usage with newer JDKs/Spring versions.
-   For a basic session sharing setup without Spring Security, this bean is not strictly necessary. Therefore, the `principalNameExtractor()` bean and its corresponding import were removed to simplify the configuration and resolve the compilation error.

## Verification

After applying these changes, the project was successfully built using Maven (`mvn clean install`) with JDK 21. This confirms that the application is now compatible with JDK 21 while retaining its core functionality of embedded Tomcat clustering and Hazelcast session sharing.

## Next Steps

The updated project is ready for testing. You can rebuild the project and run the `start-node1.sh` and `start-node2.sh` scripts to verify the clustering and session sharing functionality with JDK 21.
